<h1>3. Gathering and preparing the data set<a class="headerlink" href="#gathering-and-preparing-the-data-set" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Gathering and preparing data is a process that requires great care.
Prior to documenting a dataset, it is important to ensure that you are
working with the most appropriate version of all the concerned data
files. If the dataset is meant for public release, one should work with
the final, edited, anonymous version of the dataset. If the dataset is
being documented for archiving and internal use only, one may include
the raw data as well as the final, fully edited files. The Metadata
Editor provides you with the possibility of documenting the specificity
of each version of the dataset.</p>
<p>Much of the quality of the output generated by the Editor will depend
upon the prior preparatory work. Although the Editor can make some
changes to the data, it is highly recommended that the necessary checks
and changes be made in advance using a statistical package and a script.
This ensures accurate and replicable results.</p>
<p>This section describes the various checks and balances involved in the
data preparation process, such as: making a diagnostic on the structure
of your data, cleaning it and identifying the various variables at the
outset. Listed below are some common data problems that users encounter:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Absence of variables that uniquely identify each record of the dataset</p></li>
<li><p>Duplicate observations</p></li>
<li><p>Errors from merging multiple datasets</p></li>
<li><p>Encountering incomplete data when comparing the content of the data
files with the original survey questionnaire</p></li>
<li><p>Unlabelled data</p></li>
<li><p>Variables with missing values</p></li>
<li><p>Unnecessary or temporary variables in the data files</p></li>
<li><p>Data with sensitive information or direct identifiers</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some practical examples using a statistical package are provided in
<em>Section A “Data Validations in Stata: Practical Examples</em>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you are working in a data archive, be careful not to overwrite
your original variables. Since managing databases involves several
data-checking procedures, archive a new version in addition to the
original. Work on this new version, leaving the original data files
untouched.</p>
</div>
<p>The following procedures are recommended for preparing your dataset(s):</p>
<div class="section" id="data-files-should-be-organized-in-a-hierarchical-format">
<h2>3.1. Data files should be organized in a hierarchical format<a class="headerlink" href="#data-files-should-be-organized-in-a-hierarchical-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Look at your data and visualize it to understand its structure.
It is preferable to organize your files in a hierarchical format
instead of a flat format. In a hierarchical format, columns
contain specific information about all possible units of analysis
and rows form the individual observations (households,
establishments, products, communities/countries, or any
combination of those). Hierarchical files are easier to analyse,
as they contain fewer columns that store the same information and
are more compact. A flat format contains multiple columns with
information on only one specific unit of analysis, so the
information becomes redundant. For example, the information
provided in one column is about the household head, and the row
provides information on the child in the household.</p>
<p><strong>Table 1. Flat Format</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/Page4_1.png" src="_images/Page4_1.png" />
<p><strong>Table 2. Hierarchical Format</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/Page4_2.png" src="_images/Page4_2.png" />
<p><em>Tables 1 and 2</em> illustrate the two data structures. They
contain the same information about six people on age and their
relationship with the head of the household. The flat dataset
(Table 1) stores the information on each family member in a new
column. Note that for every additional member or characteristic,
the dataset gets flatter and wider. The hierarchical dataset
(see Table 2) has one observation and one row per person.
Each variable contains a value that measures the same attribute
across people and each record contains all values measured on the
same person across variables. For every additional member
characteristic, the dataset maintains the same number of columns,
gains additional rows and gets longer and less flat compared to
<em>Table 1</em>. The first two columns of this dataset have a
hierarchical structure, where the ID member column is nested
inside the ID household column.</p>
<p>Hierarchical files are easier to manage. Suppose in this example
that there were many characteristics measured for everyone, the
hierarchical structure would be a more convenient format because
for each new characteristic, the dataset creates only one
additional column, whereas, in the flat structure, it would
create as many columns as there are people in the data with such
characteristics.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="datasets-with-multiple-units-of-analysis-should-be-stored-in-different-data-files">
<h2>3.2. Datasets with multiple units of analysis should be stored in different data files<a class="headerlink" href="#datasets-with-multiple-units-of-analysis-should-be-stored-in-different-data-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is recommended that you store your data in different files
when you have multiple observational units. For example, <em>Table 3</em>
shows a dataset that has both household-level data (columns on
the type of dwelling and walls material) and individual-level
data (columns on the marital status, work status, and worker
category). Note that storing both levels of information in one
dataset will result in a repetition of household characteristics
for each household member. In Table 3, the information about the
columns ‘type of dwelling’ and ‘wall material’ is repeated for
everyone. Sometimes, this duplication is inefficient, and it is
easier to have the dataset broken down by observational unit, into
multiple files. In this example, it would be simpler to create two
files:  one for the household characteristics and another for the
individual characteristics. The two files can be connected through
a unique identifier, which in this case will be the household ID and
member ID. We discuss the need for this unique identifier further on
in this text as well.</p>

<div class="section" id="columns-in-a-dataset-should-represent-variables-not-values">
<h2>3.3. Columns in a dataset should represent variables, not values<a class="headerlink" href="#columns-in-a-dataset-should-represent-variables-not-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is recommended that columns represent variables (e.g., sex, age,
marital status) and rows represent observations (e.g., individuals,
households, firms, products and so forth). In some datasets, columns
instead of describing variables or attributes, describe values, which
means that one variable is broken into segments and each one is
stored in different columns. While this dataset structure can be
useful for some analysis, the standard data structure where columns
are variables and not values is the norm.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Table 4</em> (options 1 and 2) gives information at the
individual-level on marital status, relationship with the head of
the household and age. The difference between both tables is how the
variable ‘age’ is reported. Option 1 had broken the variable ‘age’
into segments. This practice makes your data: i) messier, it has
values of the variable as headings, and ii) inefficient, it increases
the size of the dataset. Option 2 is recommended since there is only
one heading and store of the information occupies less space, allowing
the user to identify the structure of the data in a clear manner.</p>

<h2>3.4. Each observation in every file must have a unique identifier<a class="headerlink" href="#each-observation-in-every-file-must-have-a-unique-identifier" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before you check for uniqueness of the identifiers in your files, you
need to figure out the unit of analysis. Even if you are not the data
producer, it is often easy to identify it. You can always review the
documentation to see if the information has been provided. Below, some
examples of units of analysis:</p>
<p><strong>Table 5. Unit of Analysis by Study type</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/Page6_2.png" src="_images/Page6_2.png" />
<p>Once you recognize the unit of analysis, the next step is to identify
the column that uniquely identifies each record. If a dataset contains
multiple related files, each record in every file must have a unique
identifier. The data producer can also choose multiple variables to
define a unique identifier. In that case, more than one column in a
dataset is used to guarantee uniqueness. These identifiers are also
called <strong>key variables</strong> or <strong>ID variables</strong> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id3" id="id1">2</a>. The variable(s) should
not contain missing values or have any duplicates. They are used by
statistical packages such as SPSS, R or Stata when data files need
to be merged for analysis</p>
<p>The absence of a unique identifier is a data quality issue, so one
needs to ensure that the unique IDs remain fixed/present during the
data cleaning process. If this correction is not possible, the archivist
should note the anomalies in the documentation process.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><em>Best Practices</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It is recommended that ID variables be defined as a numeric since
sorting and filtering records is much more efficient when
variables are numeric.</p></li>
<li><p>ID variables should not contain spaces, special characters or
accents, since they may suffer modifications when the dataset is
converted in different formats.</p></li>
<li><p>For the convenience of users of the data, avoid identifiers
consisting of too many variables. For example, in a household
survey, the household identifier should ideally be a single
variable (which you may create by concatenating a group of
variables <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id2">3</a>), and the individual identifier should be the
combination of only two variables (the household ID, and the
sequential number of each member).</p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended that you generate an ID based on a sequential
number, however, keep in mind that it should not be too long
because statistical packages and spreadsheet programs store a
number of digits of precision, so opening a data set that contains
ID variables with many characters, might result in truncated
fields. For instance, the limit of the number of characters in
Microsoft Excel is 15, so it changes any digits past the fifteenth
place to zeroes.</p></li>
<li><p>If you prepare your data files for public dissemination, it may be
preferable to generate a unique household identification that
would <strong>not</strong> be a compilation of geographic codes (because
geographic codes are highly identifying). This recommendation is
to ensure anonymity and will be explained in further detail later
on in this text. The following example shows how to construct a
unique identifier without using detailed information provided by
the geographic codes.</p></li>

<p><em>Table 7</em> below gives a hypothetical example. In this dataset, the
highlighted columns (hh1, hh2, hh3) are the key variables, which means that
they are supposed to make up the unique identifier. However, looking at
those variables, we can identify some problems: the key variables do not
uniquely identify each observation as they have the same values in rows 4
and 5, they also have some missing values (represented by asterisks),
assigned zero values and some null values (those that say NA, don’t know).
All these issues suggest that those variables are not the key variables,
and one needs to go back and double-check the data documentation.
Alternatively, the archivist could check with the data producer and ask
them how to fix these variables, in case those are indeed the key variables.</p>

<h2>3.5. Identifying duplicate observations<a class="headerlink" href="#identifying-duplicate-observations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One way to rule out problems with the unique identifier is to check if
there are duplicate observations (records with identical values for all
variables, not just the unique identifiers). Duplicate observations can
generate erroneous analysis and cause data management problems. Some
possible reasons for duplicate data are, for example, the same record
being entered twice during data collection. They could also arise from
an incorrect reading of the questionnaires during the scanning process
if paper-based methods are being used.</p>
<p>Identifying duplicate observations is a crucial step. Correcting this
issue may involve eliminating the duplicates from the dataset or giving
them some other appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Statistical packages have several commands that help identify duplicates.
<em>Table 8</em> shows examples of these commands in STATA, R and SPSS. The STATA
command <em>-duplicates report-</em> generates a table that summarizes the number
of copies for each record (across all variables). The command
<em>-duplicates tag-</em> allows us to distinguish between duplicates and unique
observations. For more details, refer to <em>Example 4</em> of <em>Section A</em>.</p>

<h2>3.6. Ensure that each individual dataset can be combined into a single database<a class="headerlink" href="#ensure-that-each-individual-dataset-can-be-combined-into-a-single-database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For organizational purposes, surveys are often stored in different datasets.
Therefore, checking the relationship between the data files is an essential
step to keep in mind throughout the data validation process. The role of
the data producer is to store the information as efficiently as possible,
which implies storing data in different files. The role of the data user is
to analyse the data as holistically as possible, which could sometimes mean
that they might have to join all the different data files into a single
file to facilitate analysis. It is essential to ensure that each of the
separate files can be combined (merged or appended depending on the case)
into a single file, should the data user want to undertake this step.</p>
<p>Use statistical software to validate that all files can be combined into
one. For a household survey, for example, verify that all records in the
individual-level files have a corresponding household in the household-level
master file. Also, verify that all households have at least on
e corresponding record in the household-roster file that lists all
individuals. Below, some considerations to keep in mind before merging data
files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The variable name of the identifier should be the same across all datasets.</p></li>
<li><p>The ID variables need to be the same type (either both numeric or both
string) across all databases.</p></li>
<li><p>Except for ID variables, it is highly recommended that the databases don’t
share the same variable names or labels.</p></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Example</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>A household survey is disseminated in two datasets; one contains
information about household characteristics and the other contains
information on the children (administered only to mothers or caretakers).

these files. Users are thus assured that all observations in the
child-level file have corresponding household information.</p></li>

<p>Panel datasets should be stored in different files as well. Having one
file per data collection period is a good practice. To combine the different
periods of a panel dataset, the data user could merge them (Adding variables
to the existing observations for the same period) or append them (Adding
observations for a different period to the existing variables). To make sure
that panels can be properly appended, the following checks are suggested:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Check for the column(s) that identifies the period of the data (Year, Wave,
Serie, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>The variable names and variable types should be the same across all datasets.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the variables use the same label and the same coding across all

<h2>3.7. Check for variables with missing values<a class="headerlink" href="#check-for-variables-with-missing-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Getting data ready for documentation also involves checking for variables
that do not provide complete information because they are full of missing
values. This step is important because missing values can have unexpected
effects on the data analysis process. Typically, missing values are defined
as a character (.a, .b, single period or asterisks), special numeric
(-1, -2) or blanks. Variables entirely comprised of missing values should
ideally not be included in the dataset. However, before excluding them, it
is useful to check whether the missing values are expected according to the
questionnaire, and the skip patterns.</p>
<p>For example, a hypothetical household survey at the individual-level
(Table 10) provides information about the respondent’s employment status.
The survey identifies if the respondent is employed in Column D, and then
provides information about the worker category in Column E, but only for
those who reported being employed in Column D. This means that those who
answered ‘unemployed’ in column D should have a valid missing value in
column E. In other words, this is a pattern in the missing values that
should be observed and duly noted.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Columns F and G are used to determine if the people who
are not employed are looking for a job and are actively seeking it. These
questions are not asked to the employed people (those who answered “yes”
in Column D), which mean that again, the missing values in those columns
correspond with what is expected. However, Column H contains information
for all employed individuals, so missing values in this column suggest
that there is a problem in the data and should be addressed. Therefore,
one should not blindly delete missing values at the outset without checking
for these patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Table 10. Checking for Missing Values: Hypothetical data set</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/Page12.png" src="_images/Page12.png" />
<p>In SPSS, use the function <em>“Missing Value Analysis”</em> and in R, do as shown
in <em>Table 11</em>. You can also use the STATA command <em>-misstable summarize-</em>
that produces a report that counts all the missing values. You can also use
the <em>-rowmiss()-</em> command with <em>-egen-</em> to generate the number of missing
values among the specified variables. For more details, refer to

<h2>3.8. Check Improper value ranges<a class="headerlink" href="#check-improper-value-ranges" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is helpful to generate descriptive statistics for all variables
(frequencies for discrete variables; min/max/mean for continuous
variables) and verify that these statistics look reasonable. Just as
there are variables that must take on only specific values, such as “F”
and “M” for gender, there are also some variables that can take on
several values (such as age or height). However, those values must fit
a particular range. For example, we don’t expect negative values, or
typically see values over 115 years for age.</p>
<p>Values for categorical variables should be guided by the questionnaire
(or separate documentation for constructed variables). If we have an
education variable that has 9 response options in the questionnaire,
the corresponding ‘education’ variable in the dataset should have 9
categories. We should not observe more than 9 unique values for this
variable. Similarly, for any questions in the survey for which the
options are only “yes”, “no” and “other”, we should not observe more
than these 3 unique values.  When out of range values exist, this might
signal data cleaning issues.</p>

<p>The technical documentation helps to form some expectations about the size
of the dataset. Make sure that in all the files, the number of records is
the same as (or is similar to) what is explicitly stated in the sample
design of your survey.</p>
<p>Suppose that you have a household survey and according to the documentation
the sample size is 50,321 households. Consequently, the file that contains
the household-level information should have a similar number of observations.
When this is not the case, you should be able to account for this difference
in data documentation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even if the number of individual records is not available
in the documentation, you can still perform a rough check on the files. For
example, if you have the household level file and the person level file, the
latter should be between 2 or 6 times larger than the former, depending on
the average household size in the country for which the information has been
collected. Another example is to compare the household level file of an
expenditure survey with the consumption level file (at the product-level).</p>
<p>The latter should have n times the number of observations than the former,
where n is the average number of products that each household records in the
survey.</p>

<p>Verify the completeness of your data files by comparing the content of these
files with the survey questionnaire. All variables in the questionnaire should
appear in the dataset, except those excluded on purpose by the producer of the
data because of reasons of confidentiality (see numeral <em>1.15</em>).
Cross-checking with the questionnaire(s) is needed to ensure that all sections
are included in the dataset.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is a good practice to make sure that the database is sorted
in the same order as the questionnaire. This practice will help users navigate
seamlessly across the dataset using the questionnaire as a route map.</p>
<p>The Stata command <em>-describe-</em> displays the names, variable labels and other
characteristics, which helps us verify that no variables have been omitted in
the database. It simultaneously confirms that all variables are correctly

<p>All data files of a sample survey should have clearly labelled variable(s)
with information on the survey weights. Sample surveys need to be
representative of a broader population for which the data is collected,
and the user needs the survey weights for almost every analysis performed.
In the case of household surveys, the survey weights are equal among
members of the same household but differ across households. Weights are
positive and strictly higher than zero. They should not have a larger
value than the population for which the survey is representative.</p>
<p>A more detailed description of how the survey weights would look like
should be provided in the documentation of the survey.  Based on it, you
can perform some basic range checks. Notice that Census datasets do not
need weights since a census collects data on all the individuals in the
population. There are however some exceptions, for example in the case of
IPUMS, the data collected are not full censuses but census samples, so
weights are required in this context.</p>
<p>Additionally, for sample surveys, verify that the variables identifying
the various levels of stratification and the primary sampling unit are
included and easily identifiable in at least one of the data files. These
variables are needed for the calculation of sampling errors.</p>

<h2>3.12. Variables and codes for categorical variables must be labelled<a class="headerlink" href="#variables-and-codes-for-categorical-variables-must-be-labelled" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Variable labels</strong></p>
<p>Labels should be short and precise. They should provide a clear
indication of what information is contained in the variables. Variable
labels are brief descriptions or attributes of each variable. Without
variable labels, users are not able to link the variables in the
database to the questions of the questionnaire. So, one should ensure
that all variables are labelled.</p>
<p>Additionally, even if variables are fully labelled, the following
practices must be considered:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Variable labels can be up to 80 characters long in Stata and 255 in
SPSS, however, it is recommended that labels be informative,  short
and accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>It is a common practice to have a literal question from the survey as
a variable label. However, the literal questions are usually longer
than the maximum number of characters, so this is not an advisable
practice.</p></li>
<li><p>The same label should not be used for two different variables.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Value labels</strong></p>
<p>Label values are used for categorical variables. To ensure the correct
encoding of data, it is important to check that the stored values in
those variables correspond to what is expected according to the
questionnaire. In the case of continuous variables, we also suggest the
checking of ranges. For instance, if the question is about the number of
working hours, the variable should not have negative values.</p>
<p>You can compare variable labels in the dataset to those in the
questionnaire using the <em>–codebook-</em> Stata command or <em>–labelbook</em>-.
Refer to <em>Example 8</em> of <em>Section A</em> for further details.</p>

<p>Remove all unnecessary or temporary variables from the data files. These
variables are not collected in the field and present no interest for users.</p>
<p>The data producer could generate variables that are only needed during the
quality control process but are not relevant to the final data user. For
example, the variable “_merge” in Stata is generated automatically after
performing the check described in the Numeral <em>1.6</em>, when the data producer
wants to see if the datasets match properly. Variables that group categories
of a question, dummy variables that identify a question’s category are all
variables produced during the coding process that are not relevant once the
analysis is completed.</p>
<p>There are cases in which calculated variables may be useful to the users, so
they must be documented in the metadata. For example, most Labor Force Surveys
(LFS) contain derived dummy variables to identify the sections of the
population that are employed or unemployed. These variables are generated
using multiple questions from the dataset and are essential elements of any
LFS. Most data users prefer to make use of them instead of computing them on
their own, to reduce the risk of error. This is a strong argument to make a
case for keeping these variables in the dataset, despite them being a
by-product of other original variables.</p>
<p>To be useful, those variables that remain in the dataset must be well
documented, else they, they may be useless to or misunderstood by users.</p>

<p>Do not include string variables if they can be converted into numeric
variables. Look at your data and check the variables’ types, particularly
for those that you expect to be numeric (age, years, number of
persons/employees/hours, income, purchases/expenditures, weights, and so
forth). If there are numeric variables stored as string variables, your
data needs cleaning.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Table 13</em> contains a data set at the individual-level with
some variables that should be numeric. The columns B (Age) and E
(Working Weeks) are stored as numeric variables, which is fine. However,
the variables ‘Number of working of hours per week’ (Column G), ‘Number
of persons working at the business’ (Column H) and ‘Monthly Income’
(Column I) are loaded as strings because there are non-numeric values
(don’t know, skip, refused to answer) and some missing values present.
Those variables need to be cleaned and converted from string variables

<h2>3.16. Compress the variables to reduce the file size<a class="headerlink" href="#compress-the-variables-to-reduce-the-file-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Compress the variables consist of reducing the size of the data file without
loss of precision or modifying the information that it provides. Listed
below are some reasons why compressing a data set may be a useful practice
for at least three reasons: First, it makes faster the process of creating
backups, uploading and downloading data files from your data repository or
any Survey Catalog. Second, it reduces the time that data users will need
to spend working with the data. Additionally, it will make the data more
accessible to the different type of users; sometimes the data size will
impose restrictions on those users who lack high computational power.
Third, it will help to free up disk space in the server where you store
your data</p>

<dt>Example</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Table 15</em> shows two versions of one dataset that provides
individual-levelinformation about the year of the first union, age,
school attendance,and health insurance. There is no difference in
the appearance of both datasets. However, version 1 was saving
uncompressed and version 2 compressed. In the uncompressed version,
the variables “ID” and “Year” are stored as double, which means that
they can store number with high decimal precision, but they
are designed to only record information of integer numbers between
-32,767 and 32,740. So, the compressed version changed the storage
type of these variables to int and saves 6 bytes per observation.
Similarly, other variables like “age” and “school attendance” are
stored as a byte in the compressed version, which saves 7 bytes
per observation when are compared to the uncompressed version.
Let’s suppose that one has a data set with 500 variables like these,
the total savings would be 3,500 bytes per observation; if this data set
has 50,000 observations, it means that the savings in memory space
would be around 175 megabytes.</p></li>

<dd><p>In Stata, this can be done through the use of the <em>group</em> function
from the <em>egen</em> command. For example, to create a variable hhid based
on a combination of variables <em>province</em>, <em>district</em>, <em>ea</em> and
<em>hhnum</em>, use the command “egen hhid=group(province district ea hh_num)”.</p>
